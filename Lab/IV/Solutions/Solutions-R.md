# Fulton Fish Market Replication

First, we will use data from Graddy (1995) who observes daily fish
prices and quantities from the Fulton Fish Market in NYC. ![Fulton Fish
Market in
NYC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Fultonfishmarket.jpg)

The goal of this paper is to estimate the demand elasticity of fish
prices $$
Q = \alpha + \delta P + \gamma X + \varepsilon
$$ Since price and quantity are simultaneous equations, we need an
instrument that shocks $P$. Graddy (1995) uses the two-day lagged
weather which determines that day’s market price for fish.

Load the Fulton Fish Market data from
`https://raw.github.com/Mixtape-Sessions/Causal-Inference-1/raw/main/Lab/IV/Fulton.dta`

``` r
library(fixest)
library(haven)

df <- haven::read_dta("../Fulton.dta")
# df <- haven::read_dta("https://raw.github.com/Mixtape-Sessions/Causal-Inference-1/raw/main/Lab/IV/Fulton.dta")
```

1.  Run OLS of `q` on `p` controlling for indicators for day of the week
    (`Mon`, `Tue`, `Wed`, `Thu`).

``` r
df |> 
  feols(q ~ p + i(Mon) + i(Tue) + i(Wed) + i(Thu), vcov="hc1")
```

2.  Instrument for `p` using the variable `Stormy` which is an indicator
    for it being stormy in the past two days.

``` r
df |>
  feols(
    q ~ i(Mon) + i(Tue) + i(Wed) + i(Thu) | 0 | 
      p ~ Stormy,
    vcov = "hc1"

    ## F-test (1st stage), p: stat = 21.5   , p = 1.015e-5, on 1 and 105 DoF.
    ##            Wu-Hausman: stat =  2.2731, p = 0.134668, on 1 and 104 DoF.

3.  Argue for or against the validity of the instrument.

*Comment:* In the classical supply and demand IV setting, you want you
instrument to affect *either* supply *or* demand, but not both. In this
setting, it would be necessary (and potentially plausible) that stormy
weather affects the suppliers only since the restaurants and people of
New York demand isn’t affected by the weather.

However, here are two potential reasons this shock affects demand as
well. First, the stormy weather could change the composition of fish
caught. In this case, you’d violate the exclusion restriction since
demand would be changing. Second, the weather could affect consumers
decisions if for example, they eat out more in the days following a
storm.

# Card Replication

Next, we will turn to the classical IV example of Card (1995). Card aims
to estimate the returns to college education, but is worried about
omitted variable bias when regressing wages on years of education. In
this case, the coefficient on education is likely biased upwards by
unobserved ability since it is plausibly positively correlated with
education and with wages.

Load the Card data from
`https://raw.github.com/scunning1975/mixtape/master/card.dta`

1.  Regress the log wage `lwage` on years of education `educ`
    controlling for experience (`exper`), an indicator for being Black
    (`black`), an indicator for being in the South (`south`), an
    indicator for being married (`married`), and an indicator for living
    in an urban area (`smsa`).

``` r
df <- haven::read_dta("https://raw.github.com/scunning1975/mixtape/master/card.dta")
```

``` r
df |> 
  feols(
    lwage ~ educ + exper + black + south + married + smsa,
    vcov = "hc1"
  )
```

    ## NOTE: 7 observations removed because of NA values (RHS: 7).

    ## (Intercept)  5.063317   0.066179  76.50992 < 2.2e-16 ***

    ## RMSE: 0.369818   Adj. R2: 0.303628

2.  Using the same set of controls, run an instrumental variables
    regression instrumenting `educ` by `nearc4` which is an indicator
    for being near a 4-year college/university.

``` r
df |> 
  feols(
    lwage ~ exper + black + south + married + smsa | 0 |
      educ ~ nearc4, 
    vcov = "hc1"
  )
```

    ## NOTE: 7 observations removed because of NA values (RHS: 7).

    ## TSLS estimation, Dep. Var.: lwage, Endo.: educ, Instr.: nearc4
    ## Second stage: Dep. Var.: lwage

    ## (Intercept)  4.162476   0.835850  4.97993 6.7209e-07 ***

    ## ---
    ## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
    ## RMSE: 0.383843   Adj. R2: 0.249808
    ## F-test (1st stage), educ: stat = 15.8    , p = 7.334e-5, on 1 and 2,996 DoF.
    ##               Wu-Hausman: stat =  1.21866, p = 0.269713, on 1 and 2,995 DoF.

3.  Compare the two results, does the IV estimate move in the direction
    we predicted above? Use the concept of LATE to describe why the
    coefficient moved in the direction it did.

*Comment:*

In the above description, if ability is correlated with years of
education, then the OLS regression coefficient for years of education
will be biased upward since it picks up on the effect of ability
(omitted variables bias). However, the IV regression coefficient
actually *increased* which is not what we would expect.

The answer that Card gives is that perhaps the individuals who are
*induced* into entering college by the instrument (being close to
college) benefit more from college than the general population. In this
case the LATE \> ATE which is why the coefficient grows larger.

Though, not covered in the course, it is possible to describe the
compliers (see [Peter Hull’s
Slides](https://nbviewer.org/github/Mixtape-Sessions/Instrumental-Variables/raw/main/Slides/03-HeterogeneousFX.pdf)).
For example, we can see that the compliers tend to have a larger
proportion of single mothers. These individuals might benefit more from
attending college than the general population, i.e. the LATE \> ATE

``` r
df |> 
  feols(
    I(sinmom14 * enroll) ~ exper + black + south + married + smsa | 0 | enroll ~ nearc4,
    vcov = "hc1"
  )
```
